\# Laptop



A \[laptop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop), often called a notebook, is a small, portable personal computer.



They integrate all the necessary components of a computer—including a display, speakers, keyboard, and pointing device (like a touchpad)—into a single unit. For power, they rely on an internal rechargeable battery or an external AC adapter.



\## Types of Laptops



Ultrabooks are designed to be extremely thin and light, often sacrificing optical drives and some connectivity ports to achieve a sleek profile.



Specialized laptops are built to handle intensive tasks that go beyond general use. Gaming laptops and mobile workstations fall into this category, featuring high-performance processors and dedicated graphics cards.



Another distinct category includes convertible or "2-in-1" laptops, which bridge the gap between tablets and traditional computers.



\## Laptop Hardware



The hardware inside a laptop is functionally similar to that of a desktop computer but is engineered for miniaturization and power efficiency. Because space is limited, components like the motherboard, memory, and storage are densely packed.



Laptop processors (CPUs) are specifically designed to produce less heat and consume less energy than their desktop counterparts to preserve battery life, often dynamically adjusting their speed based on the workload.
